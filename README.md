# Cavern

An ecology-based roguelike game.

## Concept

For generations your family has been tasked with protecting a sacred cave. You are now one of the last of your people and have fallen on hard times. You decide to explore the cave hoping to find something to allow your family to survive. What you discover instead is a web of ecosystems and a long sleeping threat that menaces the ancient cavern.
